`Identicon Sentinel` visual profile hash sentinel for spotting spoofs
------------------------------------------

`draft` `optional`

Spoofing accounts on any platorm is faily easy using a profile picture, banner image and similiar NIP05.

`Identicon Sentinel` creates an identicon of an npub using https://github.com/laurentpayot/minidenticons?tab=readme-ov-file, to sit alongside a profile image - to be used as a visual aid for users to easily spot spoof accounts.

Interopibilty is key by all using the same identicon library. https://github.com/laurentpayot/minidenticons is excellent, especially for smaller sentinel identicons.
