## Terms

- `merchant` - seller of products with NOSTR key-pair
- `customer` - buyer of products with NOSTR key-pair
- `product` - item for sale by the `merchant`
- `stall` - list of products controlled by `merchant` (a `merchant` can have multiple stalls)
- `marketplace` - clientside software for searching `stalls` and purchasing `products`

## Nostr Marketplace Clients

### Merchant admin

Where the `merchant` creates, updates and deletes `stalls` and `products`, as well as where they manage sales, payments and communication with `customers`.

The `merchant` admin software can be purely clientside, but for `convenience` and uptime, implementations will likely have a server client listening for NOSTR events.

### Marketplace

`Marketplace` software should be entirely clientside, either as a stand-alone app, or as a purely frontend webpage. A `customer` subscribes to different merchant NOSTR public keys, and those `merchants` `stalls` and `products` become listed and searchable. The marketplace client is like any other ecommerce site, with basket and checkout. `Marketplaces` may also wish to include a `customer` support area for direct message communication with `merchants`.

## `Merchant` publishing/updating products (event)

A merchant can publish these events:
| Kind    |                  | Description                                                                                                   | NIP                                     |
|---------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `0    ` | `set_meta`       | The merchant description (similar with any `nostr` public key)                                                | [NIP01       ](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/01.md)                            |
| `30017` | `set_stall`      | Create or update a stall.                                                                                     | [NIP33](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/33.md) (Parameterized Replaceable Event) |
| `30018` | `set_product`    | Create or update a product.                                                                                   | [NIP33](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/33.md) (Parameterized Replaceable Event) |
| `4    ` | `direct_message` | Communicate with the customer. The messages can be plain-text or JSON (for automatically generated responses) | [NIP09](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/09.md)                                            |
| `5    ` | `delete`         | Delete a product or a stall.                                                                                  | [NIP05](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/05.md)                                   |

**Event `30017`**
Create or update a stall.

- the stall `id` SHOULD be random generated one. Sequential IDs (`0`, `1`, `2`...) are discouraged.
- the stall `id` MUST be used as the `d` tag for the event (see [NIP33](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/33.md))

Data Structure:
```json
{
    "id": "huLUPnMmWfNbPhkkH6b529",
    "name": "Demo Stall",
    "description": "Stall with all kind of products",
    "currency": "EUR",
    "shipping": [
        {
            "name": "ZoneB",
            "cost": 2.0,
            "countries": [
                "Belgium"
            ],
            "id": "jKdBUwXfp3wbynKJU2Z3bV"
        }
    ]
}
```

Fields that are not self-explanatory:
 - `shipping`:
   - an array with possible shipping zones for this stall. The customer MUST choose exactly one shipping zone.
   - shipping to different zones can have different costs. For some goods (digital for examle) the cost can be zero.
   - the `id` is an internal value used by the merchant. This value must be sent back as the customer selection.

**Event `30018`**
Create or update a product

Data Structure:
```json
{
    "id": "YUfhcprkMSXLZtB5RCaGu2",
    "stall_id": "huLUPnMmWfNbPhkkH6b529",
    "name": "oranges",
    "description": "fresh oranges",
    "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/OrangeBloss_wb.jpg"]
    "currency": "EUR",
    "price": 5.0,
    "quantity": 20
    "specs": [["feature", "value"]]
}
```

Fields that are not self-explanatory:
 - `specs`:
   - an array of key pair values. It allows for the Customer UI to present present product specifications in a structure mode. It alsow allows comparison between products
   - eg: `[["operating_system", "Android 12.0"], ["screen_size", "6.4 inches"], ["connector_type", "USB Type C"]]`

## Checkout events

All checkout events are sent as JSON strings using ([NIP04](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/04.md)).

### Step 1: `customer` order (event)

```json
{
    "id": "60ff080d5f3eb9692e5c9899766df988d0f6470c2c58f70ec560026ab2234061",
    "name": "Some Customer",
    "address": "To my door step",
    "message": "Please use paper bags",
    "contact": {
        "nostr": "480bf053affbb9069e44a3fd72f86e2d7e5c29508ab1da8f2230c8b604642fb6",
        "phone": null,
        "email": "abc@example.com"
    },
    "items": [
        {
            "product_id": "YUfhcprkMSXLZtB5RCaGu2",
            "quantity": 1
        },
        {
            "product_id": "6AMSx8mwV2n7U5ia2VWNKo",
            "quantity": 3
        }
    ]
}

```
Optional Fields: `name`, `address`, `message`, `contact` (the objet itself and any property of it is optional)

_Open_: is `contact.nostr` required?
  
 

### Step 2: `merchant` request payment (event)

Sent back from the merchant for payment. Any payment option is valid that the merchant can check.

The below json goes in `content` of NIP-04.

`payment_options`/`type` include:

- `url` URL to a payment page, stripe, paypal, btcpayserver, etc
- `btc` onchain bitcoin address
- `ln` bitcoin lightning invoice
- `lnurl` bitcoin lnurl-pay

```
{
    "id": <String, UUID derived from sum of product ids + timestamp>,
    "message": <String, message to customer>,
    "payment_options": [
        {
            "type": <String, option type>,
            "link": <String, url, btc address, ln invoice, etc>
        },
        {
            "type": <String, option type>,
            "link": <String, url, btc address, ln invoice, etc>
        },
                {
            "type": <String, option type>,
            "link": <String, url, btc address, ln invoice, etc>
        }
}

```

### Step 3: `merchant` verify payment/shipped (event)

Once payment has been received and processed.

The below json goes in `content` of NIP-04.

```
{
    "id": <String, UUID derived from sum of product ids + timestamp>,
    "message": <String, message to customer>,
    "paid": <Bool, true/false has received payment>,
    "shipped": <Bool, true/false has been shipped>,
}

```

## Customer support events

Customer support is handle over whatever communication method was specified. If communicationg via nostr, NIP-04 is used https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/04.md.
