Nostr Internet of Things

`draft` `optional` `author:benarc` `author:blackcoffeebtc` `author:motorina0`

## Rationale

The terms/conditions of IoT software/hardware is horrible. A user should be able to message a light or heating system and ask it to turn on/off. Nostr gives the simple, permissionless development environment IoT needs.


## Terms

- `user` - user operating IoT devices with NOSTR key-pair and a client made specifically for IoT
- `device` - device to operate over Nostr with NOSTR key-pair, using a microcontroller client like <a href="https://github.com/lnbits/arduino-nostr">nostr-arduino</a>


## Nostr IoT Clients

### User

Where the `user` registers 'device'(s) and its keys, then updates the `device`(s).

### Device

The `device` uses a client like <a href="https://github.com/lnbits/arduino-nostr">nostr-arduino</a> to receive commands from the `user` or another `device`.
The `device` can also push data such as sensor readings and updates.

## Events

A `device` can publish any of the events described in [NIP-91 Event Kinds](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/iot/91.md#event-kinds).
A `user` can publish these event kinds:

| Kind    |          | Description                   | NIP                                                                                     |
|---------|----------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `30107` | `config` | Configure a device            | [NIP-107 Configure Device Event](https://github.com/arcbtc/nips/edit/nip_107/107.md#configure-device-event) |
| `8000`  | `intent` | Trigger an action on a device | [NIP-91 Event Kinds](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/iot/91.md#event-kinds) |
| `8001 - 8999`  | `data` | Publish the state of a `device` | [NIP-91 Event Kinds](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/iot/91.md#event-kinds) |


The content of events can be transmitted in clear text (for public data) or as [NIP-59 Gift Wrap](https://github.com/staab/nips/blob/NIP-59/59.md).


### Configure Device Event (`kind: 30107`)
---
This message is sent by an admin `user` to a `device`. The `device` saves the config locally and then uses it.

**Event Content**:
```json
{
    "name": <String (optional), set a name for the device>,
    "description": <String (optional), device description>,
    "categories":[ <String (optional), device category, such as 'boiler'>],
    "admin_pubkeys": [ [<String (optional), admin user public-key>]],
    "publish_to_pubkeys":[ [<String (optional), user public-key>]],
    "intents_from_pubkeys":[ [<String (optional), user public-key>]],
    "publish_on_change": <Boolean (optional, default `true`), publish event each time a sensor value changes>,
    "publish_interval": <Integer (optional), publish the sensor value at regular intervals (regardless if the value changes or not). The value is in `millisecods`.>
    "unix_time": <Integer (optional), set system time in `millisecods`.>
}
```

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `admin_pubkeys` | List of public keys that are allowed to configure this device.<br>A fresh/blank device will not have this value.<br/> The `admin_pubkeys` implicitly have the `actions_from_pubkeys` permissions. |
| `publish_to_pubkeys` | List of public keys to which events are published. |
| `actions_from_pubkeys` | List of public keys that are allowed to trigger an action on this device.<br/> The `admin_pubkeys` implicitly have the `actions_from_pubkeys` permissions. |


> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The content of the `30107` event should be encrypted if the user chooses the "encrypted" mode

**Event Tags**:
```json
  "tags": [["d", <String, pubkey of the configured device]]
```
 - the `d` tag is required, its value MUST be the same as the pubkey of the `device`.

### Intent Events (`kind: 8000`)
---
Intent Events represent different actions that can be performed on a device. These actions can be triggered by a `user` or by another `device`.
The content of the event is a `JSON` array representing the data type and the data value as specified in [NIP-91 Event Kinds](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/iot/91.md#event-kinds)

**Event Content**:
```json
 [[<Integer, between 8001 and 8999>, <Any Type> ]]
```

Example that turns on a device and sets the temperature to `20.9` degrees Celsius:
```json
[[8001, true], [8003, 20.9]]
```


**Event Tags**:
```json
  "tags": [["p", <String, pubkey of the targeted device(s)]]
```
 - the `p` tag is required, its value MUST be the same as the pubkey(s) of the target `device`(s).


### Data Events (`kind: 8001 - 8999`)
---
Data Events represent data published by `device`(s). The `kind` of the event and the `content` must follow ths specification from [NIP-91 Event Kinds](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/iot/91.md#event-kinds).

> [!NOTE]  
> If a device has more sensors attached (eg: temperature and humidity) then it will publish separate events for each measured value.

**Event Tags**:
```json
  "tags": [["p", <String, pubkey of the listening device(s)]]
```
 - the `p` tag is optional. If set then its value MUST be the same as the `publish_to_pubkeys` value from the [Configure Device Event](https://github.com/arcbtc/nips/edit/nip_107/107.md#configure-device-event-kind-30107)

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If the transmission mode is encrypted ([NIP-59 Gift Wrap](https://github.com/staab/nips/blob/NIP-59/59.md)) then an individual message must be published for each public key in `publish_to_pubkeys`.
