## Ratioanale

The terms/conditions of IoT software/hardware is horrible. A user should be able to message a light or heating and ask it to turn on/off. Nostr gives the simple, permissionless development enviroment IoT needs.

All communication happens over [NIP04](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/04.md).

## Terms

- `user` - user operating IoT device with NOSTR key-pair and a client made specifically for IoT
- `device` - device to operate over Nostr with NOSTR key-pair, using a microcontroller client like <a href="https://github.com/lnbits/arduino-nostr">nostr-arduino</a>


## Nostr IoT Clients

### User

Where the `user` registers 'device'(s) and its keys, then updates the `device`(s).

### Device

The `device` uses a client like <a href="https://github.com/lnbits/arduino-nostr">nostr-arduino</a> to receive commands from the `user` or another `device`. 
The `device` can also push data such as sensor readings and updates.

## `User` OR `device` registering/updating a `user` OR `device`

A `device` or a `user` can publish these event kinds:
| Kind    |                  | Description                                                                                                   | NIP                                     |
|---------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `4    ` | `direct_message` | Communicate between `device`(s) and `user`(s). The messages can be plain-text or JSON. | [NIP04](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/04.md) |


### Event: Register a `device`

**Event Content**:
```json
{
    "id": <String, UUID generated by the user.Sequential IDs (`0`, `1`, `2`...) are discouraged>,
    "device_id": <String, UUID of the device>,
    "name": <String, device name>,
    "description": <String (optional), device description>,
    "categories":[ <String (optional), device category, such as 'boiler'>],
    "users":[ [<String (optional), user public-key>]],
    "images": <[String], array of image URLs, optional>
}
```

Note:
 - `users`:
   - A list that can restrict access to public-keys, `device`(s) also has keys and can be a `user`.

### Event: Update a `device`

**Event Content**:
```json
{
    "id": <String, UUID generated by the merchant.Sequential IDs (`0`, `1`, `2`...) are discouraged>,
    "device_id": <String, UUID of the stall to which this device belong to>,
    "settings":[ [<String (optional), user public-key>]]
}
```

Note:
 - `settings`:
   - Standard `settings` innclude:
   - eg: `[["on", <bool>], ["range", <int, 0-1000>], ["timer_on", <int unix timestamp>], ["timer_off", <int unix timestamp>]]`
